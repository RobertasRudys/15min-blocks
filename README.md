# 15min-blocks

How much can you do in 15 minutes? Not too much. What about a 15min block? ðŸ¤”

This repository captures two ideas:

### trailblazing a learning path

I don't always know what to build, but there's always more learning material to consume.

As I continue to deepen my knowledge in math, computer science, quantum computing, and web3 - my head might explode, but this repository will stick around.

### working in a healthy and efficient way

I stand up and move away from my computer every 15 minutes for 1 minute as a micro-break.

I divide my work into 15-minute tasks to stay efficient.

I use 15-minute blocks to build things.

In the case of this repository, I'm building a knowledge base for my future colleagues.
